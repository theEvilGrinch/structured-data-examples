# Schema.org Guide

This guide provides a detailed explanation of all Schema.org properties used in the `structured-data-examples` repository, specifically within `product-landing-page.html`, `service-landing-page.html`, `online-cinema.html`, `blog.html`, and `tech-blog.html`. Schema.org markup improves how search engines like Google understand and display your web content, such as showing prices, reviews, or maps in search results. All descriptions are based on the official [Schema.org documentation](https://schema.org) (last updated April 2025) and incorporate practical recommendations from Google where applicable. They are crafted to be clear, detailed, and useful for anyone working with these files. This guide avoids examples and focuses on comprehensive, beginner-friendly explanations, adhering to modern web standards.
