# Open Graph Guide

This guide provides a detailed explanation of all Open Graph protocol fields and tags used in the `structured-data-examples` repository, specifically within `product-landing-page.html`, `service-landing-page.html`, `blog.html`, and `tech-blog.html`. Open Graph enhances how content is displayed on social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn when shared. All descriptions are based on the official [Open Graph documentation](https://ogp.me) (last updated April 2025) and incorporate practical recommendations from platforms like Facebook where applicable. They are designed to be clear, detailed, and useful for beginners, adhering to modern web standards. For `product` type in `product-landing-page.html`, the `product` namespace (`prefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns# product: http://ogp.me/ns/product#"`) is required in the `<html>` tag.
